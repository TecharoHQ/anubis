# FCrDNS (No JavaScript)

The `fcrdns` challenge dynamically verifies some legitimate bots using DNS and the client IP address. It works in three steps:

1. Reverse DNS records for the client IP are looked up.
2. Any records that match the `domain_regex` are queried.
3. The client passes the challenge if the domain has an `A` or `AAAA` record that matches the client IP.

You will need to do some searching to find out what the reverse DNS of legitimate requests should look like. Use `remote_addresses` instead if the bot you are working with cannot be identified with reverse DNS.
This challenge only makes sense for bots, so all rules using the `fcrdns` method must have a `user_agent_regex` or `expression` to identify them.

To use it in your Anubis configuration:

```yaml
# Example rule for Qwantbot: https://help.qwant.com/bot/
- name: qwantbot
  user_agent_regex: >-
    Qwantbot
  action: CHALLENGE
  domain_regex: \.qwant\.com$ # The reverse domain expected for legitimate requests (see the link above)
  challenge:
    algorithm: fcrdns
```
