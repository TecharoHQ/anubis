# Client IP Headers

Currently Anubis will always flatten the `X-Forwarded-For` when it contains multiple IP addresses. From right to left, the first IP address that is not in one of the following categories will be set as `X-Forwarded-For` in the request passed to the upstream.

- Private (`XFF_STRIP_PRIVATE`, enabled by default)
- CGNAT (always stripped)
- Link-local Unicast (always stripped)

```
Incoming: X-Forwarded-For: 1.2.3.4, 5.6.7.8, 10.0.0.1
Upstream: X-Forwarded-For: 5.6.7.8
```

This behavior will cause problems if the proxy in front of Anubis is from a public IP, such as Cloudflare, because Anubis will use the Cloudflare IP instead of your client's real IP. You will likely see all requests from your browser being blocked and/or an infinite challenge loop.

```
Incoming: X-Forwarded-For: REAL_CLIENT_IP, CF_IP
Upstream: X-Forwarded-For: CF_IP
```

As a workaround, you should configure your web server to parse an alternative source (such as `CF-Connecting-IP`), or pre-process the incoming `X-Forwarded-For` with your web server to ensure it only contains the real client IP address, then pass it to Anubis as `X-Forwarded-For`.

The `X-Real-IP` header will be automatically inferred from `X-Forwarded-For` if not set, setting it explicitly is not necessary as long as `X-Forwarded-For` contains only the real client IP. However setting it explicitly can eliminate spoofed values if your web server doesn't set this.

See [Cloudflare](environments/cloudflare.mdx) for an example configuration.
